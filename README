A genetic algorithm for playing conwayes game of life.

This project is a university project, for finding methuselahs in the game of life.

gol.py is responsible for the game simulation
individual.py is responsible for a specific individual, fitness calculations
genetic.py is responsible for the implementation of the genetic algorithm - mutations, crossovers, and the running of the algo.

running genetic.py will run the algo according to the parameters set in the main, and then print the 3 best methuselahs.

requirements - numpy and maplotlib.
